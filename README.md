# Qaotle
Project designed around a made up Mexican fast-food restaurant. Used Bootstrap 4 to design and make everything responsive.

# Landing Page

# About Us Page
Simple standard page. I used the vh display flex trick previously mentioned to center my title. Also used the opacity trick again that I used in my landing page. Copied Qdoba's mission statement for this fake about us description.

# Menu

For the menu portion, I used the Bootstrap grid system to lay everything out. I had to add another div insie the Bootstrap col classes in order for my menu to look the way I wanted it to. Added simple transitions on hover to make the UX better.
